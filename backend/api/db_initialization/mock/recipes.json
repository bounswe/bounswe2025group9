      "instructions": "Roast rice flour in a dry pan over low heat until lightly aromatic, stirring constantly to avoid burning. Meanwhile, boil treacle (or sugar syrup) with a little water and a pinch of salt until it forms a thick, sticky consistency. Gradually mix the hot treacle into the roasted rice flour and stir vigorously until it forms a smooth dough. Spread the dough into a greased tray, allow it to cool slightly, then cut into diamond shapes while still warm. Let pieces fully cool and serve.",
